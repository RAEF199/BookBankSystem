# BookBankSystem
Book Bank System is a system that allows students and faculty staff to
borrow books, tapes and articles.
It must enable students and staff members to borrow books, tapes, or articles
and allow them to borrow these materials only for a specified number of days.
Then, a penalty fee will be issued if a borrower did not return an item within
a specified duration.
This program contains a simple GUI that allows students and staff to check
the amount of fee they should pay for late returns of materials by entering
their ID.
